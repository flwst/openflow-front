# Production MCP Server Configuration
# For production deployments, the MCP server code is built into the image
# rather than mounted as a volume. This provides better security and performance.
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mcp-prod.yml up -d

version: '3.8'

services:
  workflow_mcp_server:
    build:
      context: ../../mcp-servers/workflow-server
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes: []  # Override to remove volume mounts for production
    # For production, rebuild the image when code changes:
    # docker-compose build workflow_mcp_server && docker-compose up -d workflow_mcp_server
